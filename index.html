## Basic Tools in free access

Some basic tools (Ruler, Clamp, Hammer, etc…) are available for free access within normal use. This is a complement of your student&#39;s toolkit that you should use first.

To keep the lab tools well organized, students are requested to use them only after asking one of the fabrication assistants. Students are requested to leave the tools used in his appropriate place marked in the designated area of their shelves.

Tools should remain within the fablab area, in their respective room. Taking tools out of the lab without explicit permission will be sanctioned (see chapter &#34;sanctions&#34; at the end of this document


## Power Tools and equipment on request

Power tools (Drill, Sander, ScrewDriver etc..) and some electronic equipment (Camera, Tripod, etc...) are available and will need to be requested to fab lab assistant. To keep the lab tools well organized and the process safe, students should request help to fabrication assistants. 

The students should give their ID as a deposit for the tool. This will be returned after student brings the tool back. The process includes the registration in our database of this equipment borrowing. 

All borrowed tools need to be given back in the timeframe agreed. Typical timeframe are :

● Manual &amp; Power tools 	= by the end of the day (before 8 pm)

● Equipment 			= within 24 hours

In case a student fails to do so he or she will be responsible to replace the item. Any misuse, loss or damage have to be noticed by informing one of the fabrication assistants. Failing to do so will be considered as a fault (See penalty section).


## Machines via Booking System

Some dedicated digital machines (Laser, 3D printer, etc..)  are available to students via booking system.  

The booking procedure is as follows:



*   Before accessing the online booking system, it is obligatory to contact Iaac student coordinator first: send the files you need to print, cut or mill to [fabrication.support@iaac.net](mailto:fabrication.support@iaac.net)  together with a description of the material to be processed.
*   Once your files are checked, you will receive an email with feedback and further steps, including the approx time slot you will need, only then can you book a slot on the booking system.

Failing to respect this procedure will invalidate your booking that will be cancelled by the staff. Repetitive misuse of the booking system will be considered as a fault (See penalty section).


### Booking Instructions

To make your reservation, go to [https://iaac.simplybook.it/v2/](https://iaac.simplybook.it/v2/)

1º  Select the duration of the service you need depending of the machine (30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4 hours).

2º  Select the machine you want to use: milling machine, laser cutter, 3D printer or Kuka.

3º Select the date and time: first, click the desired day in the calendar and you&#39;ll see available time slots on the right, click the one that suits you.

4º Fill your name (use your real full name, otherwise the slot will be erased), email and phone number.

5º - To finish, click &#34;BOOK NOW&#34;.

Important:



*    To confirm your booking you need to find the reservation code in your email ( you should get the confirmation email right away), paste it into the booking system, click &#34;confirm&#34;.
*   The person who makes the reservation is the person who will be allowed to use the time slot. The reservation are not transferable to other student without advising staff. Failing to do so will invalidate the booking. 
*   Punctuality is important to let everyone use the space. You are requested to come 10 min before your reservation to load your file and prepare the material. Delay from students will shorten his fabrication time on the machine and will force us to quit the job at the end of the reservation time, even if not finished. More than 15min delay will cancel the reservation. Missing your reservation without noticing the staff will be considered as a fault (See the sanction chapter).
*   Bring your material (unless your using 3D printers, see chapter &#34;Supplies&#34;) 
*   Use the machine safely (see chapter &#34;Safety&#34;)!


## Other machine and tools via email request

# Safety:

Use of this facility requires the use of standard safety precautions at all times. This includes but is not limited to:

● Never work alone

● Be aware of how to stop the machine to be used, and how to call for help before starting to use any machine.

● All students must wear safety glasses while using :



*   Milling machine
*   Circular saw/Compound saw
*   Column Drill
*   Jig-saw
*   Angle Grinder
*   Dremel
*   Sanding Machines.

● Ear protection and dust masks are available and should be worn when necessary.

● Safety glasses are the student&#39;s responsibility, students must not work in this space without them, if there aren&#39;t any available when you enter to the shop, it&#39;s no excuse to work without them. Ask for them to the Fabrication assistants!

● Only closed-toe shoes should be worn in the lab areas.

● Long hair has to be tied up. Loose clothes should be tightened, and dangling jewelry should be removed before entering the lab areas. These can get caught on the tools or machines.

● Wear a dust mask when performing grinding or other operations that may generate fine airborne particles.

● Do not leave tools on the machine when you finish. Put them in their allocated place.

● Always be aware of the safe operation of the machines. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with a particular machine, consult the workshop staff before using it.

● Do not make parts in haste. Plan each job and procedure in advance. Determine what material and special tools may be needed.

● Use the dustpan or vacuum to remove chips from a machine while it is not running; this is NOT to be done by hand.

● Each student is required to report all issues, accidents, and tool breakages to Ricardo Valbuena or the fabrication assistance (If neither are available, please report this to mathilde.marengo@iaac.net)

● No food or drinks are allowed in the workshop areas.

● Respect the machines and what they can (and can&#39;t) do; never, ever use the machines for anything other than what they were designed to do, and never tamper, alter, or play with the equipment!

● All students are required to clean the machine and sweep the work area before leaving the lab areas.


# Cleaning/Maintenance

In the interest of promoting cleaning and safe workplace, Students are required to clean all machines after use. 

In the special case of;



*   Shopboot:  includes dust under the machines, and on top of the control-box and computer. 
*   Jigsaw: you should clean it from dust and replace broken blades
*   Drill Press : Clean all the surface of the machine, table  and surroundings
*   Compound Circular saw: Cleaning surface, on top of the machine and table.
*   3D Printer: Cleaning the machine and removing small pieces from the surface.
*   Laser cutter: After using the machine remove the material and clean the top of the bed, in case of small pieces remove the bed and vacuum the left overs (call somebody from the staff for support removing the bed)

In case of the jigsaw, … In case of the Drill Press/3D printer/laser cutter... (Maybe this should go in separate sections for each machine)In the eventual case of finding a dirty machine prior to commencing your work, please advise staff and clean it before starting the job. Working in a dirty environment is dangerous, risks compromising the machine&#39;s functions and will not be tolerated.

After use machines, students are requested to leave the tools in their appropriate storage space. Correct Storage of the tools is one the key aspects, thus keeping the workplace clean and safe. Failing to respect this procedure will be considered as a fault (See the sanction chapter).

To reduce the number of waste materials and trying to promote activities on recycling and reuse it is important to separate and cut up all materials after use. Students are requested to cut up materials in different formats with the objective of proper storage. Any material with a value of more than 5€ should be kept. Wood leftovers should be cut into rectangular pieces.

In case of recycling material from the Laser cutter, it should be cut into standard sizes like A1/A2/A3/600*300mm  to facilitate storage.


# Sanctions

In order to ensure  clean, safe and healthy areas and to reduce the number of risks of regulatory failures, the Fab Lab Protocol establishes Basic regulation penalties.

The following misconducts will be sanctioned :



*   Dangerous behavior, including disrespecting the safety measures recommended in this document, will incur a penalty
*   Avoiding cleaning responsibility, especially after the use of tools and machines, will incur a penalty. 
*   Delay or not attending in any booking slot will incur a penalty. 
*   Displacing / Borrowing tools outside of the lab without having been registered by a  Fab Lab staff will incur a penalty.
*   Breaking a tool or machine without advising the Fab Lab staff, will incur a penalty.
*   Use of the lab without supervision will incur a penalty (the Fab Lab is fitted with a surveillance system).

The first act of misconduct will be sanctioned with a formal warning through an  email communicating the specific misconduct and asking for a greater attention. 

The second act of misconduct will incur a penalty: the student will be prohibited  from using the Fab Lab machines during one week.

The third act of misconduct will directly forbid the student&#39;s access to  the Fab Lab space until the end of the semester. 

Students have to send the file as soon as the slot is booked to use a machine, to the fabrication assistants to check and be prepared to run the file directly without wasting any time. The USB drives will not be accepted to review the files by the fabrication assistants strictly

Every person should have their individual door keys and which is not transferable. In case of visitors, the responsible persons need to to be notified before letting anyone inside the building. Failure to do so, the student will be penalised.

The students are advised not to keep their belonging like coats, helmets and bags obstructing the functioning and movement of people in the building. Failure to do this could incur a penalty
