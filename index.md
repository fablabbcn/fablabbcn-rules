To use any Digital Fabrication machine, you need to book it. 

The instructions for the Booking system can be found [HERE](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/educational-docs/about/booking/)


> Failure to respect the rules and conditions pertaining to the booking system will result in a cancellation of the booking by staff. Repetitive misuse of the booking system will be considered a fault.

#### General rules for Booking Slots

‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware ‚ö†Ô∏è


- ONE-SLOT RULE. Students are not allowed to use more than one slot per machine per day. Take into consideration that many other users need access too.

- NO-SOLO USE. Students cannot use machines without supervision.

- JUST FOR EDUCATION. It's not allowed to use the machines for personal projects outside the specific free slots made available by the team, according to availability. It is forbidden to use the machines for commercial purposes.

- NON-TRANSFERRABLE. The person who makes the reservation will be the only one allowed to use the time slot. Reservations are non-transferable. Failing to comply will automatically cancel the booking.

- FILES READY BEFORE SLOT! Students should come with a file prepared beforehand and ready to launch at the beginning of their slot.

- FILE TYPE. It is mandatory to have your files in Rhino v6 file, .DXF or .STL to properly use the machines.

- BE PUNCTUAL. Punctuality is important to allow everyone fair use of the space. You are requested to come 10 min before your reservation to prepare your material and file. Any delay will shorten that student‚Äôs fabrication time on the machine. A delay of more than 15 minutes automatically results in a canceled reservation. Missing your reservation without notifying Fab lab staff will be considered as a fault (See Penalties section).

- PLAN AHEAD. Plan well ahead, and make your request at least 48h before needed. If your project requires more time than what is typically allocated on the booking system, it is obligatory to contact your assigned fabrication expert with the files you need to print, cut or mill along with a description of the material to be used.

- CLEAN! Students should always keep workspaces clean after use and return any tools.

- BYOM. Bring your own material (unless you are using the 3D printers, see Supplies section)

- STAY SAFE. Always stay attentive and practice safe machine usage (See Safety)!



### Hazardous Materials

Working safely with hazardous chemicals requires proper use of laboratory equipment. Maintenance and regular inspection of laboratory equipment are essential parts of this activity.Please note that special attention would be required for the use of the laboratory, many of the accidents that occur in the laboratory can be attributed to improper use or maintenance oflaboratory equipment.

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 143133](/assets/Screenshot%202022-01-24%20143133.jpg)

IAAC provides students with gloves and lab coats. Please note that care should be taken to use gloves when handling laboratory equipment to protect against electrical, thermal, and chemical burns, cuts, and punctures. Some materials, such as graphene nanoplates, require specific staff supervision and control of their use. Students are not allowed to take products provided by IAAC outside of IAAC facilities. Trash, algae, batteries or any other material substances that can obstruct the sink should not be disposed of via wastewater. Students should use the respective bins located around the buildings.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

‚ö†Ô∏è Students are required to clean all machines after use ‚ö†Ô∏è

In the interest of promoting a clean and safe workplace, Students are required to clean all machines after use. In the special case of:

Put special attention to:
* CNC Milling: Includes small dust pieces anywhere on or under the machine, and on top of the control-box and computer.
* Jigsaw: Should be cleaned from dust and replaced any broken blades.
* Drill Press: Clean all the surface of the machine, table and surroundings.
* Compound Circular saw: Cleaning surface, on top of the machine and table. 
* 3D Printer: Cleaning the machine and removing small pieces from the platform.
* Laser cutter: After using the machine remove the material and clean the top of the bed, in case of small pieces removed the bed and vacuum the leftovers (call somebody from the staff for support removing the bed)
* Bio & Matter Lab: leaving the surfaces clear and clean, in the case of materials that are drying out such as plaster casting, notify the fabricant assistant.
* Carpenter tables in the wood workshop.

‚ùóÔ∏è In the case of finding a dirty machine prior to commencing your work, please report it to staff or you will have to clean it yourself. Working in a dirty environment is dangerous, risks compromising the machine‚Äôs safety or operation and will not be tolerated. 

‚ùóÔ∏è Part of cleaning is putting back all the tools in their appropriate storage space. 

‚ùóÔ∏è Failing to comply with any of these will be considered as a fault (See Penalty section). In an effort to reduce the amount of waste materials and promote recycling and reuse, it is important to separate and cut down all material off-cuts after use. Students are requested to cut up materials, such as wood and acrylics, in rectangular formats for easy storage.

## EQUITY, EQUALITY & DIVERSITY

IAAC‚Äôs Students, Instructors, Faculty, Evaluators, Collaborators, and Staff are expected to demonstrate appropriate judgment, ethical personal behavior, and common sense. 

It is IAAC‚Äôs pledge to making participation in our programs and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our code of conduct is based on the following pillars:

**RESPECT:** We are in equity. Participants uphold human dignity and promote equality and emotional and cognitive development. Participants must demonstrate respect for spiritual and cultural values, diversity, social justice, freedom, and the environment.

**INTEGRITY:** We are transparent. Honesty, reliability and moral action are embodied in integrity. Participants must exercise integrity through their work commitments, responsibilities and actions.

**TRUST:** We all work as a team. Trust embodies fairness, openness and honesty between all participants.

**CARE:** We lean on each other. Participants must show this through positive influence, support to others, and empathy in practice.

While it is not possible to list all forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the context of working and making together, the following are examples of infractions of our code of conduct that may result in suspension and/or other disciplinary action:

* Behavior that constitutes discrimination against, or harassment of, an employee, collaborator, student, or any other person in the context of Fab Academy classes, courses, lectures, work, etc.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Theft, unauthorized use, removal, or taking of another's property
* Bringing or use of any dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the work or classe space.
* Plagiarism, copying other people‚Äôs work without proper reference
* Acting in an unprofessional manner and/or discourtesy to others (co-workers, students, visitors, team members, collaborators, etc)

### Non Discrimination and Equal Opportunities
Every participant of any project or program (students, instructors, faculty, evaluators, collaborators and staff) must behave in a non discriminatory way and without any regard to race, color, religion, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, marital status, disability, veteran or draft status.

IAAC staff  is responsible for making reasonable accommodations wherever necessary for all students and participants with disabilities. IAAC commits to thoroughly investigate instances of alleged discrimination and take corrective action.

### Anti-Harassment and Anti Bullying
Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a person's protected status, such as color, sex, physical or mental disability, national origin, ancestry, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristic.

IAAC will not tolerate any harassing conduct that affects any individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Harassment can take many forms, including, but not limited to: words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation, physical contact, or violence. Harassment can occur either because of direct intent or via conduct that has an unintended, but real, negative effect on others.

Bullying is defined as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans, intimidates, or humiliates people either as an individual or as a group. It also has potential adverse consequences for all involved; its often persistent and part of a pattern, but it can also occur as a single incident. It is usually carried out by an individual but can also be an aspect of group behavior. Bullying is unacceptable behavior,  inconsistent with our principles of equality and fairness, and IAAC will not tolerate any form of bullying in any of our programs and projects.


**Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity!**
