## EQUITY, EQUALITY & DIVERSITY

IAAC‚Äôs Students, Instructors, Faculty, Evaluators, Collaborators, and Staff are expected to demonstrate appropriate judgment, ethical personal behavior, and common sense.

It is IAAC‚Äôs pledge to making participation in our programs and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our code of conduct is based on the following pillars:

**RESPECT:** We are in equity. Participants uphold human dignity and promote equality and emotional and cognitive development. Participants must demonstrate respect for spiritual and cultural values, diversity, social justice, freedom, and the environment.

**INTEGRITY:** We are transparent. Honesty, reliability and moral action are embodied in integrity. Participants must exercise integrity through their work commitments, responsibilities and actions.

**TRUST:** We all work as a team. Trust embodies fairness, openness and honesty between all participants.

**CARE:** We lean on each other. Participants must show this through positive influence, support to others, and empathy in practice.

While it is not possible to list all forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the context of working and making together, the following are examples of infractions of our code of conduct that may result in suspension and/or other disciplinary action:

* Behavior that constitutes discrimination against, or harassment of, an employee, collaborator, student, or any other person in the context of Fab Academy classes, courses, lectures, work, etc.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Theft, unauthorized use, removal, or taking of another's property
* Bringing or use of any dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the work or classe space.
* Plagiarism, copying other people‚Äôs work without proper reference
* Acting in an unprofessional manner and/or discourtesy to others (co-workers, students, visitors, team members, collaborators, etc)

### Non Discrimination and Equal Opportunities
Every participant of any project or program (students, instructors, faculty, evaluators, collaborators and staff) must behave in a non discriminatory way and without any regard to race, color, religion, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, marital status, disability, veteran or draft status.

IAAC staff  is responsible for making reasonable accommodations wherever necessary for all students and participants with disabilities. IAAC commits to thoroughly investigate instances of alleged discrimination and take corrective action.

### Anti-Harassment and Anti Bullying
Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a person's protected status, such as color, sex, physical or mental disability, national origin, ancestry, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristic.

IAAC will not tolerate any harassing conduct that affects any individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Harassment can take many forms, including, but not limited to: words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation, physical contact, or violence. Harassment can occur either because of direct intent or via conduct that has an unintended, but real, negative effect on others.

Bullying is defined as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans, intimidates, or humiliates people either as an individual or as a group. It also has potential adverse consequences for all involved; its often persistent and part of a pattern, but it can also occur as a single incident. It is usually carried out by an individual but can also be an aspect of group behavior. Bullying is unacceptable behavior,  inconsistent with our principles of equality and fairness, and IAAC will not tolerate any form of bullying in any of our programs and projects.


**Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity!**
