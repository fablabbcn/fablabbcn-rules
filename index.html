<p>The students should give their ID as a deposit for the tool. This will be returned after student brings the tool back. The process includes the registration in our database of this equipment borrowing. </p>
<p>All borrowed tools need to be given back in the timeframe agreed. Typical timeframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manual &amp; Power tools  = by the end of the day (before 8 pm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment         = within 24 hours</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In case a student fails to do so he or she will be responsible to replace the item. Any misuse, loss or damage have to be noticed by informing one of the fabrication assistants. Failing to do so will be considered as a fault (See Penalty section).</p>
<h2>Machines via Booking System</h2>
<p>Some dedicated digital machines (Laser, 3D printer, etc..)  are available to students via booking system.  </p>
   ![image alt text](image_21.jpg)               ![image alt text](image_22.jpg)    ![image alt text](image_23.jpg)

<p>The booking procedure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before accessing the online booking system, it is obligatory to contact Iaac student coordinator first: send the files you need to print, cut or mill to <a href="mailto:fabrication.support@iaac.net">fabrication.support@iaac.net</a>  together with a description of the material to be processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your files are checked, you will receive an email with feedback and further steps, including the approx time slot you will need, only then can you book a slot on the booking system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to respect this procedure will invalidate your booking and it will be cancelled by the staff. Repetitive misuse of the booking system will be considered as a fault (See penalty section).</p>
<h3>Booking Instructions</h3>
<p>To make your reservation, go to <a href="https://iaac.simplybook.it/v2/">https://iaac.simplybook.it/v2/</a></p>
<p>1º  - Select the duration of the service you need depending of the machine (30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4 hours).</p>
<p>2º  - Select the machine you want to use: milling machine, laser cutter, 3D printer or Kuka.</p>
<p>3º  - Select the date and time: first, click the desired day in the calendar and you'll see available time slots on the right, click the one that suits you.</p>
<p>4º  - Fill in your name (use your full, real name, otherwise the slot will be cancelled), email and phone number.</p>
<p>5º  - To finish, click "BOOK NOW".</p>
<p>Important:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To confirm your booking you need to find the reservation code in your email ( you should get the confirmation email right away), paste it into the booking system, click "confirm".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person who makes the reservation is the person who will be allowed to use the time slot. The reservation are not transferable to other student without advising staff. Failing to do so will invalidate the booking. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Punctuality is important to let everyone use the space. You are requested to come 10 min before your reservation to load your file and prepare the material. Delay from students will shorten his fabrication time on the machine and will force us to quit the job at the end of the reservation time, even if not finished. More than 15min delay will cancel the reservation. Missing your reservation without notifying  fab lab staff will be considered as a fault (See the Penalties chapter).</p>
